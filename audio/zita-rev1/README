zita-rev1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for
Aeolus. Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used
on a wide variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser -
the early reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not
correspond to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and
right sources to some extent.
