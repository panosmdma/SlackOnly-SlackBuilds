SPL is a powerful and feature-rich scripting language with hashes,
regular expressions, objects, exceptions and a c-style syntax. 

The SPL VM is a pure bytecode interpeter. The entire SPL toolchain 
(compiler, assembler, virtual machine, etc) only requires about 
100k and the additional memory usage by the applications is also
small. One of the more advanced VM features is the capability to
dump the entire VM state to a file and resume later. It is even 
possible to resume on another machine with a different architecture.

SPL has support for loadable modules. The spl package contains 
modules for databases (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL), XML (incl. XPATH 
and XSLT), Terminal and File IO, Web Application development 
(the CGI, WSF and W2T (Web 2.0 Toolkit) modules), SDL, Qt3, OpenGL 
and more. 

SPL can optionally be compiled with support for Postgres. 

The SlackBuild script will install Vim syntax highlighting for SPL,
but it still must be activated in the user's .vimrc before it will
activated. See /usr/doc/spl for programming examples and a language 
reference.
