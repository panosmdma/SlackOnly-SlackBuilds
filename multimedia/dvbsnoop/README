dvbsnoop is a DVB / MPEG stream analyzer program, which enables you to
watch (live) stream information in human readable form.

Its purpose is to debug, dump or view digital stream information
(e.g. digital television broadcasts) send via satellite, cable or
terrestrial. Streams can be SI, PES or TS. Basically you can describe
dvbsnoop as a "swiss army knife" analyzing program for DVB, MHP, DSM-CC
or MPEG - similar to TCP network sniffer programs like the old and famous
snoop on Sun Solaris or tcpdump on Linux (which is in fact a kind of
a clone of SunOS 'snoop'). You may also analyze offline mpeg streams,
e.g. stored on DVD or mpeg2 movie files.

dvbsnoop is a command line based program. It's text output can be used
to for postprocessing via scripts or graphical analysis software like
MRTG or gnu-plot.
