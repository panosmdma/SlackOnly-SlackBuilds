The Linux Console Project evolves from the command-line tools (jscal, jstest,
and jsattach) which were included in Version 1 of the Linux Joystick Driver.

The original set of tools has been expanded and now includes utilities to test
and configure joysticks, connect legacy devices to the kernel's input subsystem
(providing support for serial mice, touchscreens etc.), and test the input event
layer.

* this replaces the "joystick" build that was previously available
* included in this build is a simple udev rule to automatically restore the
  joystick configuration(s); see the package README in the documentation
  directory for more specific rules
