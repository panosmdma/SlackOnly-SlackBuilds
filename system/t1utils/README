t1utils is a collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs.  Together,
they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB (binary) formats,
disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable form, and reassemble them
into PFA or PFB format.  Additionally you can extract font resources from
a Macintosh font file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font
file from a PFA or PFB font.

* t1ascii:  changes PFB (binary) fonts into PFA (ASCII) format
* t1binary:  goes the opposite direction
* t1disasm:  translates PFBs or PFAs into a human-readable and -editable format
* t1asm:  goes the opposite direction
* t1unmac:  translates a Macintosh Type 1 font into either PFB or PFA format
* t1mac:  goes the opposite direction

NOTE: You do not need t1utils if you already have texlive installed as it is
already included there. However, installing it anyway doesn't do any harm
either.
