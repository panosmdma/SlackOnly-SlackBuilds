SpliX is a set of CUPS printer drivers for SPL (Samsung Printer Language)
printers. It covers several Samsung and Xerox printers. See ppd/*.ppd in
the tarball for supported models. Only SPL2 and SPLc printers are 
currently supported; however, work is in progress to implement support 
for other SPL printers.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
If you are upgrading your current version, you MUST delete your printer 
in the CUPS interface and install it again. This operation MUST be done 
since CUPS caches a copy of the PPD file, so if the PPD changes from one
version of splix to the next, cups will still have the cached copy.

IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT THE JBIG ALGORITHM:
JBIG-KIT is an optional dependency for SpliX, but it seems that parts of this
algorithm was previously or is still patented. To disable the use of JBIG, add
NO_JBIG=1 when executing the build script: NO_JBIG=1 ./splix.SlackBuild
Unfortunately, JBIG printers (such as the CLP-600) won't work with SpliX if 
the JBIG algorithm is disabled.
