hddtemp (reads hard disk S.M.A.R.T. info and reports temperature)

hddtemp is a small and daemonizable utility designed to read the
S.M.A.R.T. information from the given hard disk and report the
temperature of the disk. Different hard disk manufacturers use
different raw values in their S.M.A.R.T. data and the hddtemp.db file
helps to map raw values to actual temperatures.

The hddtemp.db file does not include more recent hard disks as the
project does not appear to be maintained anymore. To resolve this,
simply add your disk to the file manually. Run hddtemp on your drive
to get the expected string and use the other entries in the file as
templates to create a new one.

Note that only a few hard disks actually differ from the 194C value so
you can bet your disk will probably use that value too, but I
recommend using older drives from the same manufacturer that are in the
file as a guideline.
