BleachBit deletes unnecessary files to free valuable disk space, maintain
privacy, and remove junk. Rid your system of old clutter including cache,
cookies, Internet history, localizations, logs, temporary files, and broken
shortcuts. Designed for Linux systems, it wipes clean Adobe Reader, APT,
Bash, Beagle, Chromium, Epiphany, Firefox, Flash, GIMP, Google Earth,
Java, KDE, OpenOffice.org, Opera, RealPlayer, Second Life viewer, Skype,
VIM, XChat, Yum, and more.

As with all automated "cleaning" programs, exercise caution and review
the output before committing any changes to disk.
