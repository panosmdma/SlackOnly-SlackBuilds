gcolor2 is a simple color selector that was originally based on gcolor,
ported to use GTK+2, and now has a completely new UI.

It is also completely desktop-independent, requiring only GTK2.

It includes the usual color wheel method, input box method, color-picker
method, and can store colors, coming with the contents of rgb.txt
already stored.
