NVClock is a small utility that allows users to overclock NVIDIA based video 
cards running on the Linux platform. The original code used in building this 
application was borrowed from the nvcs application. That code has been 
extensively reworked in order to make the utility much more user friendly and 
to make it play nice with current distros and drivers.

Overclocking can be dangerous and can cause system instability and/or damaged 
hardware.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
