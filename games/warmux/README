Warmux - War is declared !

Have the mascots of your favorite free softwares battle in the Warmux arena.
Using dynamite, grenades, baseball bat and others bazookas,... exterminate 
your opponent in a 2D toon style scenery and a funny environment.

Each player (2 minimum on the same PC or network game with 0.8 version) 
controls the team of his choice (penguin, gnu, firefox, wilber,...) and must 
destroy his adversary using more or less casual weapons.

Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, Warmux is
pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each 
member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to his opponents.
