PySolFC (PySol Fanclub Edition) is a solitaire suite containing over 1000
individual games.

PySolFC comes with several different cardsets, but there is a large number
of optional cardsets available.  To install the additional cardsets
systemwide, have the cardset tarball in the SlackBuild directory at build
time.  If you do not want to install the extra cardsets systemwide, or
decide to add them later, they can be extracted to ~/.PySolFC/cardsets

The extra cardsets tarball is available here:
