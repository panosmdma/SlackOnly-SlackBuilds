The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) is a terminal status monitor for Tor
relays, intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone
stuck with a tty terminal. This works much like top does for system usage,
providing real time statistics for:

    - bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
    - relay's current configuration
    - logged events
    - connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)
    - etc.

This SlackBuild will also verify the package's PGP signature
if the following conditions are met:

    - You have Damian Johnson's (the author) public PGP key (0x9ABBEEC6)
      in your trustedkeys.gpg keyring
    - You have downloaded the sig file from
