openssh-krb5 (Secure Shell daemon and clients - with Kerberos)

ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace
rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.

This package builds openssh with Kerberos support, and it does not 
conflict with the stock Slackware package (in fact, that package needs
to stay, as this depends on other files contained in it).

You will need to start /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd.krb5 during boot.
