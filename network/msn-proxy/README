msn-proxy is a light-weight transparent proxy for MSN Messenger clients that
allows you to control and monitor the use of Messenger on your network.

This SlackBuild installs the msn-proxy web pages in /var/www/htdocs/
To change the location, set the DOCROOT variable:
# DOCROOT=your/docroot/dir ./msn-proxy.SlackBuild
(be sure to omit the leading "/" from the path; for example, use "home/www/"
instead of "/home/www/" if your preferred DOCROOT is /home/www/.

This needs httpd, php, mysql configured & running.

See the included README.SLACKWARE file for configuration instructions.
