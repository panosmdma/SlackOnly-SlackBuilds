A portable extension that provides the power of OpenSSL to Tcl programs.
This extension can be used to utilize SSL encryption on top of any valid
Tcl Channel not just sockets. The sockets behave exactly the same as
channels created using Tcl's built-in socket command, with additional
options for controlling the SSL session.
