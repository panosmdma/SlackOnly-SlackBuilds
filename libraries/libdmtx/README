libdmtx (Data Matrix barcode library and utilities)

libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data Matrix barcodes
on Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows, and some mobile devices. At its core libdmtx
is a shared library, allowing C/C++ programs to use its capabilities without
restrictions or overhead. The included utility programs, dmtxread and
dmtxwrite, serve as the official interface to libdmtx from the command line.
