R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation,
calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has

* an effective data handling and storage facility,

* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular
  matrices,

* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for
  data analysis,

* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly
  at the computer or on hardcopy, and

* a well developed, simple and effective programming language (called
  `S') which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive
  functions and input and output facilities. (Indeed most of the
  system supplied functions are themselves written in the S language.)

If you do not need to build the R shared library (which is needed if
you would like to call R functions from other applications), execute
the script as R_SHLIB=no ./R.SlackBuild

If you do not need to build the BLAS shared library (which is useful
for swapping default unaccelerated BLAS for an accelerated one),
execute the script as BLAS_SHLIB=no ./R.SlackBuild
