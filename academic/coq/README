Coq implements a program specification and mathematical higher-level
language called Gallina that is based on an expressive formal language
called the Calculus of Inductive Constructions that itself combines both
a higher-order logic and a richly-typed functional programming language.

If you have ocamlopt, Coq will be compiled to native code, which runs 4-10 
times faster. For best performance, OCaml should have support for pthreads. 

If you want CoqIDE, you need LablGTK2 (>= 2.10.0) with development
files, and GTK2+ (>= 2.10.0).  This also REQUIRES OCaml to have support
for pthreads.

If you have emacs installed, emacs files for Coq will be installed.
Otherwise, they will be omitted.
